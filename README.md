# ðŸŽ§ Clown Music Visualizer

## Description
This project is a real-time 3D music visualizer built with **Three.js**, **Web Audio API**, and **JavaScript**. It features a reactive clown face that changes expression and behavior based on the intensity of the audio.

The project integrates **Jamendoâ€™s API** to allow music search and streaming, as well as local audio upload support. Visuals include animated face parts and a fire particle system triggered by audio frequencies.
