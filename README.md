# ðŸŽ§ Clown Music Visualizer

## Description
Three.js, Web Audio API and JavaScript were used to create this live 3D visualizer in my project. The face of the clown moves according to the noise produced and keeps changing expressions.

The project uses Jamendoâ€™s API to enable users to search, play and upload music they recorded locally. This work includes animated facial movements and a set of fire particles responding to sound emitted by the audio tracks.
